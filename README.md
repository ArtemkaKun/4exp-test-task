# Game description

This game was inspired by DOOM game series. 

Controls (as described in the task document) were made with Google Cardboard SDK. Moving your phone will cause a camera moving in the game. Tap on the screen will cause one shoot from the weapon. You will interact with the UI (like restart round button) with the screen tap as well.

Make sure that sound on the your phone is turned on - the game contains a few sounds.

The game was developed with Unity 2019.4.21f. The game was tested on the Xiaomi Mi6 only, without using Cardboard.

# Troubleshooting

Problems are don't expected, because the game is super simple and was tested a lot of times. But you can clash with 1 problem - gthe game doesn't start or work incorrectly. In this case, make sure that you are using a smartphone with OS minimum of Android 9.

# 3rd assets usage

All code in the project is mine. Most of the graphical assets (like models and textures) are mine also.

Only things, that were grabbed from web resources:

* All sounds (got from free sound libraries)
* A few realistic textures, like metal and wood (got from free texture library)
* Skybox (got from random free Unity Asset)
